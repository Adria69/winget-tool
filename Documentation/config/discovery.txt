discovery.bare::
	'(Protected config only)' Specifies whether Git will work with a
	bare repository that it found during repository discovery. This
	has no effect if the repository is specified directly via the
	--git-dir command-line option or the GIT_DIR environment
	variable (see linkgit:git[1]).
+
The currently supported values are:
+
* `always`: Git always works with bare repositories
* `never`: Git never works with bare repositories
+
This defaults to `always`, but this default may change in the future.
+
If you do not use bare repositories in your workflow, then it may be
beneficial to set `discovery.bare` to `never` in your global config.
This will protect you from attacks that involve cloning a repository
that contains a bare repository and running a Git command within that
directory.
